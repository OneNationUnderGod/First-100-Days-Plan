Introduction: Why I Am Doing This
I grew up in Houston, Texas, where Joel Osteen was my pastor. I was raised on the message of goodwill toward others, of faith in humanity and the belief that we should serve one another with kindness and integrity. But after joining the military, I witnessed the same man who preached love and unity lock his church doors to those in need when their lives were expendable for new carpet during a hurricane. That was the moment I realized: America has lost its way.
For the third election cycle in a row, I have watched as my fellow Americans were forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. Where our leaders were not selected because of what they could do for America—but in spite of what they would do to it. We have been divided, manipulated, and conditioned to believe that this is just how things are. But I refuse to sit back and let this continue. No longer will I watch America be torn apart.
I blame myself as well. For the third election cycle in a row, I sat on the sidelines, believing that people would find the answers on their own. That knowledge, discussion, and hope would be enough. Time and time again, I was asked: “What are you doing about it?” And I would respond with a shrug and say, “Talking about it.”
Talking is no longer enough. I will not just point out the problems—I will provide solutions. And I invite every single person, from every square inch of not only America but the world, to help build a better nation. A nation that has spent decades blindly moving forward like the Rumbling of Titans, crushing everything in its path. I don’t know how this story ends, but I will not sit back and let America destroy itself.

Why These Executive Orders Matter
I do not have the ability to enact these policies myself. I am 29 years old—by the time I am of age to run for president, the damage may already be done. But that does not mean we cannot act now. This plan exists not because I seek power but because I seek solutions. This document is my answer to the question, “What are you doing about it?”
Each executive order is designed to address an urgent problem in America that can no longer be ignored. These are not abstract ideas. They are immediate actions that should be taken by whoever holds power in the Oval Office. If our leaders will not act, then we, the people, must push them to do so. This is more than a policy plan—this is a call for accountability.
Whoever is in a position of power—if they have not read or do not acknowledge this document—they do not have your best interests at heart. They are not American in spirit, and they cannot be trusted.
We live in a time where we can’t even agree on what a lore-accurate Superman movie should look like. We argue over whether Captain America’s shield belongs to one person or if it should be wielded by whoever has the heart to carry it forward. Some of us fight over who the best Spider-Man is, but we all know the answer: the best version of Spider-Man is the one that is OUR friendly neighborhood Spider-Man—the one who protects the people, not just the city.
So I’ll give America a symbol. A message that anyone can wear the shield. That heroism isn’t reserved for the powerful, the rich, or the privileged. The true leaders of this country should be those who believe in justice, mercy, and the responsibility to do what is right—not because it benefits them politically, but because it is the right thing to do.
I have sought answers, not to the meaning of life, but to the meaning of hate. Why does it exist? It has never made sense to me. And yet, it thrives, poisoning our communities, our politics, and our future. Hate is a disease, and this document is the cure.
The person who takes up this cause—who carries the weight of these policies—must be one who envisions the same future I do: Peace on Earth.
This is not just about governing. This is about leading a movement for the soul of a nation. If the person in power does not recognize the urgency of this plan, then they are not leading America—they are leading its downfall.
This is a matter of national survival. The enemies of democracy are not just foreign adversaries but also those within our own borders who use wealth, influence, and deception to maintain control over a struggling population.
Corruption is not just an unfortunate byproduct of politics—it is a deliberate act of theft against the American people. Those who refuse to challenge it, those who ignore the cries for justice, are complicit in the destruction of the American dream. They are not our leaders—they are our captors.
This document is a blueprint to break those chains and restore power to the people. Every policy written here is an act of defiance against those who profit from your suffering. Every reform is a demand that government works for you—not for billionaires, not for lobbyists, not for corporate overlords.
If we fail to act, then the cycle continues. More suffering, more division, more excuses. But I refuse to accept that fate. You should refuse to accept it too.
There will be no more asking, no more waiting, no more hoping that someone will save us. We will save ourselves.
If the current leadership will not enact these policies, then they have failed America. And they must be replaced.
We do not have time for incremental change. The time for bold, revolutionary action is now.
This is not just about politics. This is about justice. This is about freedom. This is about securing the future of this nation before it is too late.
One Nation. Under God. Indivisible. With Liberty and Justice for All.

Q&A – Addressing Key Concerns
1. How are you going to penalize companies hoarding profits overseas?
Solution:
Global Minimum Tax Treaty → Ensure U.S. corporations owe the difference in taxes no matter where they move their profits.
Automatic IRS audits for any corporation reporting high overseas profits while operating in the U.S.
Exit Tax Penalties → If a company relocates solely to avoid taxation, they face a heavy financial penalty.
Tax Repatriation Incentives → Offer one-time low-tax reinvestment options if corporations return overseas funds for U.S. job creation.
2. Who qualifies as a federal anti-corruption watchdog?
The Judas Branch (Anti-Corruption Task Force) will be:
Completely independent from Congress and the Executive Branch to prevent politicization.
Run by career investigators, legal scholars, and ethics officers, selected through a bipartisan, public process.
Overseen by a Public Ethics Tribunal, including civil rights leaders, retired judges, and watchdog groups.
3. How can we ensure the Judas Branch won’t be controlled by the wrong people?
Prevention Measures:
Director serves a one-time, non-renewable 6-year term to avoid political influence.
Any attempt to dismantle or interfere with the branch triggers automatic Congressional oversight and emergency hearings.
Strict public transparency → Investigations must be reported to the American people.
4. What kind of investigative power will the Judas Branch have?
Legal Authority Includes:
Subpoena Power → Can demand financial records, emails, and memos from politicians, corporations, and government agencies.
Criminal Referral Authority → Can refer cases directly to the DOJ for prosecution.
Asset Seizure for Corrupt Officials → Any illicit wealth gained through corruption can be frozen and reclaimed.
Public Hearings for Major Investigations → Government corruption cases will be aired publicly to ensure accountability.
No politician, government official, or billionaire will be above the law.
5. Are we following a positivist theory for criminal justice reform?
Yes. Instead of blanket sentencing, the system will:
Ensure nonviolent offenders get rehabilitation over incarceration.
Require mental health evaluations before sentencing.
Use restorative justice methods (victims involved in sentencing).
The punishment will fit the individual, not just the crime.
6. How do you ensure racial profiling isn’t used in investigations?
Prevention Measures:
Federal ban on racial profiling → Any evidence obtained through profiling will be automatically inadmissible in court.
Independent Civilian Oversight Boards → Every state must have a citizen-led review board monitoring police activity.
Body Cameras & AI-Driven Crime Analysis → Ensures pattern-based policing over racially motivated stops.
7. What are the plans to rebuild diplomatic ties?
Three-Step Strategy:
Reaffirm commitments to NATO, UN, and global trade partnerships.
Hold high-level summits with allied nations in the first six months to reset international relations.
Remove corporate influence from foreign policy—diplomatic decisions must be based on security & human rights, not business interests.
8. How do we deal with adversarial governments?
Three-Pronged Approach:
Diplomacy First → Engage directly with foreign leaders on neutral ground before tensions escalate.
Economic Leverage Over Military Threats → Sanctions targeted at leaders & oligarchs, not civilians.
Defensive Strength Without Provocation → Strengthen cybersecurity and intelligence gathering without reckless military engagement.
9. How do we assure the American people we can handle global threats?
Transparent & Strategic National Security:
Declassify security strategies that don’t endanger intelligence operations—so Americans know where we stand.
Public oversight for military actions → No more secret wars or unauthorized conflicts.
Doctrine of Peace Through Strength → America will always defend itself, but never provoke unnecessary war.
10. How will billionaires be forced to actually pay taxes instead of evading them?
Three-Part Crackdown:
No More Offshore Loopholes → Global tax agreements ensure billionaires cannot move wealth abroad to escape taxes.
Automatic IRS Audits for the Ultra-Wealthy → Any individual or corporation making over $100M is subject to annual forensic audits.
Hard Consequences for Evasion →
Executives face personal liability for corporate tax fraud.
Federal contract bans for companies caught cheating.
Asset seizure for extreme tax fraud.
Billionaires will either pay their fair share or lose money, power, and assets.
11. How will you ensure IRS enforcement doesn’t hurt small businesses?
Safeguards for Small Businesses:
Companies making under $5 million/year are exempt from federal corporate tax audits unless flagged for direct fraud.
No small business penalties for honest tax mistakes → IRS will offer tax preparation assistance instead of fines.
Small business tax breaks → Lower corporate tax rates for businesses with fewer than 100 employees.
Tax enforcement will only target billionaires & multinational corporations.
12. What are the investigative limits of the Judas Branch? How do we ensure it doesn’t become corrupt?
Checks & Balances:
Oversight by a Public Ethics Tribunal → Investigations must be reviewed by a bipartisan panel of legal experts & watchdog groups.
Judicial Review for All Major Actions → Any subpoenas, asset seizures, or criminal referrals must be approved by a federal judge.
Full Transparency Reports → Major investigations must be publicly disclosed unless they involve classified national security matters.
If the Judas Branch is ever found engaging in misconduct, leadership faces automatic removal & criminal charges.

Final Takeaway:
These policies are not just promises—they are enforceable, transparent, and protected from abuse.
Corruption will be rooted out. Billionaires will be held accountable. National security will be handled with strength and wisdom.
Every safeguard is in place to protect small businesses, the working class, and American democracy.

We, the People of the United States, stand together as one nation, indivisible.
In a time of division, corruption, and fear, we declare that we will no longer be controlled by hatred, deception, or greed. We will not be ruled by those who exploit our differences for power, nor by those who place personal wealth above the well-being of the people.
We make this declaration today—not as Democrats or Republicans, not as the rich or the poor, not as separate races, religions, or identities—but as Americans.
The Three Big NO’s – The Line in the Sand
From this day forward, we commit to these three absolute rejections:
NO TYRANTS.

No leader shall hold power unchecked, and no government shall act against the will of its people.

Every American is equal, and we will protect one another.
We will not allow discrimination to dictate our policies or our future.
NO BULLIES.
We reject those who seek to dominate through fear, manipulation, or force—whether in government, corporations, or everyday life.
